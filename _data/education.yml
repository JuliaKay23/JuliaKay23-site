    During my time at the University of Alabama I was very involved on campus. I held many leadership positions such as President of Eta Kappa Nu, Finance Vice President of Alpha Delta Pi, Secretary of Alpha Kappa Psi, and various other positions. I also received the Eta Kappa Nu Outstanding Senior Award in 2018 and the Fred R. Maxwell Jr. Award in 2017.
